**GDPR**

This plugin does not collect any data. So it does _not_ do anything to make your site _less_ compliant with GDPR. I have done my best to ensure that this plugin is 100% GDPR compliant, but I'm not a lawyer so can't guarantee anything. To determine if your site is GDPR compliant, please consult an attorney.
